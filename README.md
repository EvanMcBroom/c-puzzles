# C Puzzles

These are C puzzles that were made for an undergraduate [CTF](https://ctftime.org/) club meeting. The goal of each puzzle was to provide the correct input for the program to output *You solved it!*. You may modify the source code to assist you in understanding what the code is doing, but do not introduce print statements, and do not use a debugger or a disassembler.
